Hey, Student1, it has been a long semester and I have some feedback for you.
It’s nice to have you in class! You are doing well in class and your tests have reflected your skills very well. I believe you have a firm understanding of the concepts, and I hope that you continue to demonstrate your skills throughout the second semester. I always love hearing your interesting opinions, and I appreciate that you are talking every class. Continue to keep up the good work, and don’t hesitate to ask a question or two whenever you need help or clarification. You have done a great job of completing the nightly homework, and have shown that you understand the material very well. I hope that you continue this work next semester, and let me know if you have any questions. You are doing a great job in class this semester. You have shown great comprehension of the class material and are always willing to back up your ideas with evidence. Great job! You seem to be enjoying the class, however you don’t seem to be actively engaging with the material or myself. I would encourage you to be a little more present next semester. You are doing a good job at applying my feedback to your work. You have elevated the quality of your work on multiple occasions due to utilization of my suggestions. Continue this habit next semester! Keep up the good work! This semester has been a little rough, but I believe that you have a lot of opportunities. I hope you work hard to improve in the areas where you need it, and I feel that you will become a strong student in this class.
