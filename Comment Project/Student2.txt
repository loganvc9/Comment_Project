Hey, Student2, it has been a long semester and I have some feedback for you.
It’s nice to work with you in class! You seem to be doing okay with problem solving and comprehension of the material. From grading your exams, I believe there is still room for improvement, however you are starting to really grasp the concepts taught so far. Although you occasionally offer your input, I believe that you should aim to participate more in class discussions. I know you have great ideas, and I want you to share with the class a little bit more. I have noticed that you are not regularly completing the homework, and at times you are having trouble completing it. Please let me know whenever you have trouble, and we should start meeting after school to sort out whatever questions you have. You are doing a great job in class this semester. You have shown great comprehension of the class material and are always willing to back up your ideas with evidence. Great job! You seem to be enjoying the class, however you don’t seem to be actively engaging with the material or myself. I would encourage you to be a little more present next semester. You are doing a great job at applying my feedback to your work. I enjoy watching you improve as you take suggestions and use them to your advantage. Keep up the good work! Keep up the good work! Overall, you have demonstrated a lot of good work this semester. I have enjoyed your opinions and ideas in class and I hope that you continue to produce good work and keep a good attitude.
