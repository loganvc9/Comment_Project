Hey, Student3, it has been a long semester and I have some feedback for you.
It’s nice to have you in class! You nailed all the quizzes that have been put into class! It was a pleasure to see your quiz without using any of the red ink. Keep up the good work! You did a great job on class discussions, and you should be proud. Your contributions to In-class participation are proficient and everybody in your group looks up to your opinion in different discussion events. Keep on going! The homework situation was something that I have never worried about you. You are great at doing this thing, and I also know that from your advisor. You showed your improvements in understanding concepts, and it’s nice to see you learning new things. You really understand what you are looking for in class. One of our main goals in this class is to have fun, and you did it! You are doing a good job at applying my feedback to your work. You have elevated the quality of your work on multiple occasions due to utilization of my suggestions. Continue this habit next semester! Keep up the good work! Overall, you have shown adequate skills throughout the semester. You have room for growth and I see potential in you. The next step in this course for you is to apply the suggestions I have given you, and work to grow in the areas where you need some improvement.
